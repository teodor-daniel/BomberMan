# üéÆ  Project README: BomberMan Game

## üåü Overview
This is a Bomberman like game developed as a third-year computer engineering project. This Arduino-based game combines strategy, quick thinking, and a bit of luck. Players navigate through a matrix, place bombs to destroy walls, and avoid getting caught in the blast radius. The project involves hardware components like an LED matrix, joystick, buttons, and an LCD display, along with software written in C++ for the Arduino platform.

## üìñ Backstory

**Game Story:** My recreation of the classic Bomberman game using Arduino is more than just a project; it's a tribute to my first encounter with video gaming. This game holds a special place in my heart, tracing back to when I was just 4 years old. My first gaming experience was on my father's work computer, where an internet provider's CD introduced me to four iconic games: Bomberman, Heroes III, Dungeon Siege, and Red Alert 2.

Despite not knowing English at the time, I was captivated by Bomberman's simple yet compelling gameplay. I quickly learned the game's core mechanics - placing bombs strategically to destroy walls and skillfully avoiding the ensuing explosions. After about 10 hours of playtime, I achieved what felt like a monumental feat at that age - beating the game. That triumph and the joy it brought me remain vivid in my memory, even 17 years later.

Creating this Arduino-based version of Bomberman is my way of reconnecting with that cherished childhood memory. It's a homage to the game that introduced me to a world of strategy, excitement, and the sheer fun of gaming.
